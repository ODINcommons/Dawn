# ODIN Core Protocol v0.1 (Working Draft)

> _"The forge for fire-bearers."_

## 1. Purpose of the Protocol

The ODIN Core Protocol sets the baseline for how ODIN Nodes operate, collaborate, and protect the integrity of the network. Unlike the Constitution, which defines our shared values and vision, the Protocol is practical and enforceable—designed for replication, resilience, and impact.

## 2. Node Principles

Each ODIN Node must uphold the following:

- **Open**: All tools, knowledge, and outcomes must be open-source and accessible.
- **Distributed**: Ownership and governance are decentralized, peer-validated, and community-driven.
- **Impactful**: Projects and learning must be rooted in real-world relevance—serving communities and ecosystems.

## 3. Minimum Technical & Operational Criteria

To function as a recognized ODIN Node, the following baseline is expected:

- A mobile or stationary space equipped with accessible tools (e.g., solar-powered energy, basic fabrication tools, digital learning access).
- Commitment to safe, accessible, inclusive, and curiosity-driven learning.
- Documented learning processes and outcomes (shared via ODIN repositories).
- Integration of the "SOLE" and "Feynman Loop" models for inquiry-based learning.

## 4. Licensing & Anti-Cooption Protection

ODIN materials and outputs will operate under:

- **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)**
- Optional **Peer Production License** for commercial limitation
- Nodes may not privatize, brand, or resell ODIN-origin materials without open access.
- All funders or partners must respect ODIN’s open knowledge ethos.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Node Stewards**: Facilitate local learning, safety, and sharing.
- **Contributors**: Build, teach, create content, or design new tools.
- **Guardians (e.g. Hex Council)**: Steward protocol evolution, resolve conflicts, and guard ethos.
- **Users**: Learners, local communities, and co-creators who engage with the Node.

## 6. Interoperability & Scaling

- Nodes are autonomous but interoperable via open standards.
- Sharing is encouraged through a distributed knowledge mesh (e.g., ODIN Git, P2P learning loops).
- Any individual or group may replicate a Node if they:

  - Agree to the Protocol and Constitution
  - Are peer-validated by at least 2 existing nodes or Guardians

## 7. Dispute Resolution & Protocol Evolution

- Nodes or contributors may raise concerns via ODIN’s open forum or Guardian channel.
- Violations are mediated through a transparent resolution process.
- The Protocol is reviewed bi-annually with community input and consensus changes.

## 8. Appendices (To Follow)

- Glossary of core terms
- Sample modular Node layouts
- Sample SOLE session templates
- Role nomination process (e.g. Hex Council)
- Governance flow diagrams
