_Build the open and democratic foundations for ODIN._

### **Deadline:**

_07/06/2025_

## 1. Finalise the ODIN Constitution v0.1 (Foundational)

### **Objective:**

_Establish the foundational values, governance principles, and non-negotiable commitments that will guide ODIN’s development, partnerships, and long-term integrity. This living document serves as a social contract and a memory of purpose._

- All review constitution and add edits
- Complete draft of sections 4-7
  
  4. **Infrastructure & Code**
  5. **Contributions, Attribution & Value**
  6. **Memory & Evolution**
  7. **Philosophical Backbone**

- Create any sections we feel are missing
- Agree on v0.1 (Foundational) draft

## 2. Finalise the ODIN Protocol v0.1 (Foundational)

### **Objective:** 

_Define the core operational procedures, peer accountability mechanisms, and ethical guardrails that ensure ODIN remains transparent, resilient, and aligned with its founding purpose._

- All to review protocol and add edits
- Agree on v0.1 (Foundational) draft

## 3. Finalise the ODIN Potential Collaborator Communications Package v0.1 (Foundational)

### **Objective:** 

_Craft a compelling and values-driven communications package that clearly articulates hy ODIN exists, why it matters now, and why collaboration is essential. We need to balance visionary narrative with practical information, ensuring alignment with our founding principles._

### Potential Framing Questions:

- Why does the world need ODIN now? _(Contextual narrative: ecological crisis, digital sovereignty, education gaps, extractive economies)_

- What future is ODIN helping to create? _(Vision statement in plain, inspiring language)_

- How is ODIN different from existing initiatives? _(Highlight distributed governance, open value networks, peer learning, and full value accounting)_

- What does meaningful collaboration with ODIN look like? _(Set expectations: partnership, not ownership; shared stewardship, not sponsorship)_

### Tasks:

1. Define the ideal collaborator profile.
    - Who shares our values? Who benefits from a thriving commons? (e.g., social enterprises, open-source tech groups, mission-aligned corporates like SAP, grassroots organisations.)

2. Identify and clearly state why we want to invite them.
    - Are they thought leaders, resource holders, pilot partners, or amplifiers?

3. Determine the communication style that best fits each target group.
    - Example: Formal narrative for institutional partners; more poetic/visionary for values-driven networks; conversational for grassroots groups.

4. Decide on using the Block structure 
    - (e.g., Block 1: The Origin Story, Block 2: Why the World Needs ODIN Now, Block 3: How You Can Be Involved) or an alternative narrative format.

5. Draft a One-Pager “Why the World Needs ODIN Now”.
    - This becomes the anchor for all outreach and can double as a shareable artifact.

6. Create the Collaborator Communications Package:

    - Cover Letter Template
    - One-Pager (PDF + plain text formats)
    - Invitation to Co-Create (inviting feedback, not just participation)
    - Link to Draft Constitution (if appropriate for transparency)

7. Review, edit, and commit final Collaborator Communications Package v0.1


## 4. Finalise the ODIN Contributor Onboarding Package v0.1 (Foundational)

### **Objective:** 

_Provide new contributors with a clear, inspiring, and accessible introduction to ODIN—its purpose, progress, and ways to get involved—empowering them to take meaningful action from day one._

- Drafdt README.md covering:

  - What is ODIN?
  - Who is it for?
  - Why does it exist?
  - What exists so far?
  - What are you working on now?
  - How can I get involved?

## 5. Finalise the ODIN Governance Model v0.1 (Foundational)

### **Objective:**

_Define the structures and processes that will guide collective decision-making, economic fairness, and distributed leadership across ODIN. Ensure governance reflects the values of open collaboration and long-term resilience_

- Define core governance elements

  - Voting and delegated trust
  - Roles in ODIN Nodes
  - Economic Fairness Model

## 6. Inaugurate the Founding Hexagon Council.

### **Objective:**

- Set responsibilities and accountabilities
- Celebrate founding of ODIN

## 7. Launch www.odincommons.org

### **Objective:**

_Establish ODIN’s digital presence as a public commons, showcasing its founding framework and providing an accessible entry point for collaborators and communities._

- Select plan on greenserver.net

## **Outcome:**
