## Why are we here?

**We are living through the most dangerous period in human history.**

Don't take our word for it. Read the [2025 Doomsday Clock Statement](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/2025-statement/).

We have successfully built the most complex and interconnected civilisation known in the universe. But with that power, we’ve also created the conditions for our own collapse.

The economic, social, political, and technological systems we've built have unleashed cascading crises that grow more frequent, complex, and severe every year.
From climate breakdown and mass extinction to runaway AI and nuclear brinkmanship, we face threats not just to our survival, but to the very ecosystems that made our existence possible.

We’re now on a trajectory fulfilling one of the most unsettling explanations for the [**Fermi Paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#cite_note-98):

<details>
<summary> Que?</summary>

The **Fermi Paradox** is the contradiction between the high likelihood of intelligent extraterrestrial life in the universe and our total lack of contact with or evidence for it.

In simple terms:

> _If the universe is vast and ancient, where is everyone?_

One possible answer is disturbing: intelligent life tends to destroy itself before it can spread or be noticed.

</details>

> _**It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself.**_

In [_Intelligent Life in the Universe_](https://dn790001.ca.archive.org/0/items/SaganIL/SaganIntelligentLife.pdf), Carl Sagan and Iosif Shklovsky speculated that although technological civilisations tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communication, it is possible, though rare, that some overcome these self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales.

The question before all of us now is simple:

> _**Will we be among those civilisations who endure, or will we become an echo in the cosmic silence?**_

If we are to endure, we must overcome problems, barriers, inequalities, obstacles, and challenges, that are anything but simple, _together_.

The old models we used to get here cannot solve the problems they helped create.

**ODIN is an invitation to _co-create_ what comes next.**

While we may not sit in positions of global power, we _do_ hold the power to help each other.

ODIN believes that despite our seemingly preordained self-destructive tendencies, humanity can work together to solve problems without relying on the extractive or exploitative systems that brought us to this precipice.

**ODIN exists to offer a doorway to new ways of questioning, learning, connecting, collaborating, creating, building, growing, and sharing: beyond borders, institutions, and the gatekeepers of knowledge and power.**

## What Is ODIN?

ODIN is a remix, like everything else.

We’re a social impact movement rooted in the principles of **open source**, **peer-to-peer collaboration**, **creative commons**, **self-organisation**, **decentralised governance**, and **distributed technologies**.

ODIN is a growing network for **collaborative and self-organised learning, hacking, creating, making, growing, sharing, and solving real-world problems**.

We’re here to test a simple hypothesis:

> **When people learn together, build together, and share freely, we make faster, fairer progress than any institution ever could.**

To test this, we’re blending:  
– the proven power of **Self-Organised Learning Environments** (SOLEs)  
– the creativity of **hackerspaces and maker labs**  
– and a shared focus on **practical challenges, from local to planetary scales**

We aim to bridge the gap between **theory and practice**, and help the next generation step around the phone-shaped hole we’ve accidentally built for them.

In the near future, we’ll extend this with **distributed ledgers** and **agent-centric technologies** like **Holochain** to coordinate learning, trust, and shared value without centralised control.

<summary> Sidequest: What do you mean by remix?</summary>

If you didn’t know already, [Everything is a Remix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series).

ODIN builds on the legacy of P2P culture, creative commons, open-source collaboration, and peer production. It remixes these ideas to serve the present moment.
