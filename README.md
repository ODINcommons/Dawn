# ODIN - Open Distributed Impact Network

## Mission

To empower communities around the world through open, decentralised learning and innovation, making knowledge and tools accessible to everyone, and fostering collaborative solutions for a better future.
---

## Vision

A world where knowledge flows freely across all borders, where every community has the tools and confidence to innovate and solve their own challenges, and where collaborative, open-source learning environments inspire endless creativity and sustainable progress. Ultimately, a future where ODIN hubs are thriving hubs of ingenuity, inclusivity, and hope, lighting up every corner of the globe.

## What Is ODINcommons?

ODINcommons is a remix, like everything else.

We’re a social impact movement rooted in the principles of **open source**, **peer-to-peer collaboration**, **creative commons**, **self-organisation**, **decentralised governance**, and **distributed technologies**.

ODIN is a growing network for **collaborative and self-organised learning, hacking, creating, making, growing, sharing, and solving real-world problems**.

We’re here to prove:

> **When people learn together, build together, and share freely, we make faster, fairer progress than any institution ever could.**

To test this, we’re blending:  
– the proven power of **Self-Organised Learning Environments** (SOLEs)  
– the creativity of **hackerspaces and maker labs**  
– and a shared focus on **practical challenges, from local to planetary scales**

We aim to bridge the gap between **theory and practice**, and help the next generation step around the phone-shaped hole we’ve accidentally built for them.

In the near future, we’ll extend this with **distributed ledgers** and **agent-centric technologies** like **Holochain** to coordinate learning, trust, and shared value without centralised control.

<summary> Sidequest: What do you mean by remix?</summary>

If you didn’t know already, [Everything is a Remix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series).

ODIN builds on the legacy of P2P culture, creative commons, open-source collaboration, and peer production. It remixes these ideas to serve the present moment.
