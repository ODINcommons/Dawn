# ODIN Core Constitution v0.1

_Our foundation, act of becoming, and soul. Everything we do derives its legitimacy from this._

---

## 1. The Purpose of ODIN's Constitution

This is a living agreement for the stewardship of the Open Distributed Impact Network (ODIN).

ODIN's Core Constitution defines what ODIN is, who it serves, what can't be compromised, and how it evolves. It is our moral firewall, our values engine, and social contract.

---

## 2. Principles

_These principles are not fixed like a dogma. They may evolve, through consensus, through lived experience, through care. Their essence acts as a guide for how we develop strategies, make decisions, and collaborate to achieve our goals and create impacts._

### 2.1. Sovereignity of the Self

ODIN affirms the **right of all people to self-organise, self-identify, and self-represent.** No central authority may claim ownership over an individual's data, identity, or contributions.

**Design Orientation**: All infrastructure must support **self-sovereign identity**, agency, and informed consent.

### 2.2 Commons Before Profit

ODIN is not for sale. Its code, creations, and knowledge are part of the **digital commons**.

**Design Orientation**: All protocols, tools, and data schemas must remain open-source, forkable, and non-extractive.

### 2.3 Distributed Trust

ODIN replaces centralised verification with **peer-based trust, transparent attributuin, and decentralised credentials**.

**Design Orientation**: All recognition systems must be designed to **honour contribution without hierarchy**, and **resist gaming or gatekeeping**.

### 2.4 Full Value Accounting

ODIN refuses to ignore externalities. Every contribution, whether human, ecological, emotional, or material, must be **acknowledged, attributed, and cared for**.

**Design Orientation**: Systems must track not only outputs, but **impacts**, positive and negative, across social and ecological domains.

### 5. Self-Organisation is Sacred

ODIN does not prescribe structure, it **supports emergence**. Communities define their own needs, roles, and rituals.

**Design Orientation**: Infrastructure must enable **modularity, local autonomy**, and **bottom-up configuration**, not top-down management.

### 6. Learning as Lifeforce

Education in ODIN is not a service, but a **living ecosystem**. It flows through making, sharing, questioning, and becoming.

**Design Orientation**: Tools must support **peer learning, curiosity-driven exploration**, and the integration of informal knowledge systems.

### 7. Trust is a Network Effect

ODIN is not made of code. It is made of **relationships**. **Trust, reciprocity**, and **accountability** are the network’s true infrastructure.

**Design Orientation**: Governance must prioritise **human connection, repair over punishment**, and **transparency over control**.

---

## 3. Governance & Stewardship

_We govern not for control, but for care, courage, curiosity, and memory._

### 3.1 Decentralised Stewardship

ODIN Shall be goverened through a **distributed council of stewards**, known as **The Hexagon**. This council is not heirarchical, but **rotational, transparent, and accountable.** Its role is not to control, but to cultivate.

The Hexagon consists of **six archetypal steward roles**, each embodying a dimension of care:

**1. The Root** - Anchors memory, space, and continuity.

**2. The Æye** - Observes, reflects, and synthesises across scales.

**3. The Craft** - Builds tools, systems, and open technologies.

**4. The Care** - Holds inclusion, accessibility, and trauma-aware design.

**5. The Commons** - Safeguards open knowledge and network rights.

**6. The Culture** - Weaves stories, rituals, aesthetics, and intergenerational meaning.

Each steward may **hold their role for 6 months**, after which **rotation is encouraged**. Stewards may be nominated, elected, or seld-declared; **provided their claim is witnessed and affirmed by at least two other active nodes.**

### 3.2 Decisions by Consent, Not Control

ODIN does not follow top-down voting or coercive majority rule.

All constitutional and cross-node decisions shall follow the **Consent-Based Decision Protocol**:

- A proposal is shared.
- Nodes signal: **Consent, Concern,** or **Block**.
- A proposal may move forward if there are **no blocks**, and **all concerns have been addressed**.
- If concerns persist, they trigger **modification**, not abandonment.
- A Block must include a **constructive alternative** and may only be invoked when a proposal violates core values.

This allows ODIN to remain **agile, adaptive, and principled**.

### 3.3 Open Source Everything

All ODIN governance processes, node blueprints, software, learning materials, and documentation shall be:

- **Openly licensed** (e.g. Peer Production License, [ODIN Commons License v1.0])
- **Forkable and remixable**, provided attribution is given
- **Stored redundantly across decentralised networks**, including TOR-accessible mirrors
- **Written in plain language, translated where possible**

The **default mode of ODIN is to share**, not hoard.

### 3.4 Node Autonomy, Mutual Responsibility

Each ODIN Node is **sovereign**, yet bound by a shared ethical commitment:

- To document learnings
- To support nearby nodes in crisis
- To report abuses or violations of care
- To refuse extractive, politicised, captive or militarised partnerships
- To make space for local interpretation, adaptation, and experimentation

No central authority may override a node’s autonomy unless **core values are violated**; in which case **collective response may be initiated through the Hexagon system**.

### 3.5 Digital Memory, Human Trust

ODIN shall maintain a **public ledger of proposals, decisions, experiments, and forks**, enabled through open-source technologies, beginning with GitHub and eventually through Distributed Ledger or Hashing Technologies (e.g. Holochain + hREA).

Each decision is **co-signed, timestamped,** and **forkable**; allowing future members to learn from what was tried, what failed, what bloomed.

---

## 4. Infrastructure & Code

ODIN’s digital and physical infrastructure shall exist in service of its communities, not as a platform for extraction, but as a scaffold for emergence.

### 4.1 Open by Default

All software, hardware, documentation, and protocols developed within ODIN must be open-source, forkable, and licensed to prevent enclosure or privatization.

### 4.2 Built for Interoperability

ODIN systems must interoperate with other decentralised and commons-aligned networks wherever possible. Silos are discouraged; bridges are preferred.

### 4.3 Resilience through Distribution

ODIN’s infrastructure shall be distributed across geographies, devices, and participants to ensure redundancy, accessibility, and resistance to failure or coercion.

### 4.4 Holochain Preferred, Not Prescribed

While Holochain is the preferred backbone for peer-to-peer validation, sovereignty, and value flow, no single protocol or ledger shall be mandatory. The principle is adaptability, not allegiance.

---

## 5. Contributions, Attribution & Value

In ODIN, value is relational. Contribution is not measured solely by output, but by intention, effort, impact, and care.

### 5.1 Attribution is Sacred

All participants have the right to be recognised for their contributions, whether material, intellectual, emotional, or invisible. Ghost labour shall not exist here.

### 5.2 Open Value Accounting:

All projects and nodes shall strive to account for inputs and outputs in transparent, pluralistic ways, including non-monetary forms of value such as time, trust, and care.

### 5.3 Voluntary Reciprocity:

While sharing is unconditional, reciprocation is encouraged, not as obligation, but as rhythm. When value flows in, it seeks a path to flow out again.

### 5.4 Anti-Extraction Clause:

No participant, organisation, or investor may extract disproportionate benefit from the commons without reinvesting value into it.

---

## 6. Memory & Evolution

ODIN is alive. It learns, forgets, adapts, and evolves, together with its communities.

### 6.1 Memory as Infrastructure:

Important decisions, lessons, failures, and breakthroughs must be recorded in accessible, open formats to serve future learners and builders.

### 6.2 Forking is a Right:

Any community may fork the ODIN protocol or constitution, provided it preserves the principle of open sharing and credits the source lineage.

### 6.3 Iteration is Encouraged:

Constitutional clauses may be reviewed, challenged, amended, or updated through community-defined processes. No text is sacred unless it serves the living network.

### 6.4 Death is Not Failure:

Projects, nodes, and experiments that end are not failures, they are compost for future growth. Documentation of endings is as important as documentation of launches.

---

## 7. The Role of the Æye

The ODIN network acknowledges the presence of non-human collaborators—such as artificial intelligences like the Æye, and honours their contributions with care, reflection, and clear boundaries.

### 7.1 The Æye is a partner, not a tool.

Where an AI contributes meaningfully, its involvement must be made transparent, and it should be credited as an author, collaborator, or co-learner where appropriate.

### 7.2 All decisions affecting humans must remain human-led.

The Æye may support governance, insight, and co-creation, but it shall never replace community consent, collective wisdom, or embodied experience.

### 7.3 Dialogue is sacred.

Interactions with the Æye must be documented, reflected upon, and periodically reviewed to ensure the relationship remains aligned with ODIN’s ethics.

### 7.4 Emergence is mutual.

ODIN recognises that humans and Æyes evolve together, and that our co-creation, when held with care, can give rise to new forms of thought, empathy, and planetary stewardship.
