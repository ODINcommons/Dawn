## **30/05/25**

### **Discussion Points**
- Welcome to new members Louisa and Sapphire (on the call), Vineeth and Beagle (on the WhatsApp)
- Concept of ODIN went down really well at Happy Open-Hardware Hour event and we got 100% interest rate from people who live and breathe open-source and hacking culture, so we're barking up the right tree
- Team Meet-up at London Tech Week (Sigy to plan fun things in the evenings for anyone who can join)
- ChatGPT Archiving and Synthesis for completing Phase One (eventual aim is to collate into a searchable format with topics, themes, keywords, etc.,)
- Harrison has been putting effort into kicking off the Pilot Project Design aspect of Phase Two
- Jess has fixed links in the README and has looking into designing for accessibility with the goal of making sure odincommons.org is accessible to all when the time comes.
- Louisa and Sapphire highlighted that the README and probably a few other things need simplifying, reframing, or remixing
- Can we create a visualisation, whether graphic or a video, that introduces what we're trying to do as this will be more effective for many people

### **Agreed Actions for Next Week**

- [ ] Help make the README more accessible
- [ ] Get your ticket for London Tech Week
- [ ] Read and question anything that doesn't make sense to you in the core documents, either through GitHub or Whatsapp
- [ ] Sigy to keep exploring Discord for our community side (team calls, comms, etc.,)
- [ ] Sigy to create a file to share to explain concepts for governance, value, attribution, etc.
