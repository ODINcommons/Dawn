## Summary Discussion

### Background context

Sigy: I watched Sugata Mitra's Ted Talk in 2013, and had the opportunity to help run SOLEs for refugee children at The Cube in Athens. They were both transformative experiences, and led to the first foundational element of ODIN.

While in Greece (Khora - refugee charity), and in Bristol (Skipchen - food waste charity), we created and built awesome projects that helped people step-by-step, one challenge at a time. I feel I have been trying to work too many things out before getting physically started with piloting the first part of the project: SOLEs.

I propose we set our current objective as:

### Objective:
  - Run 3 SOLE pilot sessions in 3 locations in 3 months by December 2025
### Strategy:
  - Engage with personal and local networks, connections, communities to find: spaces, devices, materials, participants, and facilitators
### Tactics:
  - Reach out to relevant contacts (direct, indirect, targetted) via direct message, email, or phone to find:
    - Spaces to host SOLEs (London, Isle of Wight, Bristol) 
    - Devices (laptops, tablets, AV recording, portable projector)
    - Materials (sharpies, colouring pens, scissors, tape, rulers, flipcharts, etc.)
    - Participants (schools, youth clubs, community centres, etc.)
    - Facilitators (grandmas, parents, young people)

### Questions
  - What are they?
  - Why are they effective?
  - How do they fit into ODIN?
  - How do we pilot some SOLE sessions?
  - Who could we engage as participants?
  - Who can we ask to help facilitate them?
  - What spaces are suitable?
  - Where would be good locations to trial them?
  - What materials do we need?
  - What techonologies do we need?

## **30/05/25**

### **Discussion Points**
- Welcome to new members Louisa and Sapphire (on the call), Vineeth and Beagle (on the WhatsApp)
- Concept of ODIN went down really well at Happy Open-Hardware Hour event and we got 100% interest rate from people who live and breathe open-source and hacking culture, so we're barking up the right tree
- Team Meet-up at London Tech Week (Sigy to plan fun things in the evenings for anyone who can join)
- ChatGPT Archiving and Synthesis for completing Phase One (eventual aim is to collate into a searchable format with topics, themes, keywords, etc.,)
- Harrison has been putting effort into kicking off the Pilot Project Design aspect of Phase Two
- Jess has fixed links in the README and has looking into designing for accessibility with the goal of making sure odincommons.org is accessible to all when the time comes.
- Louisa and Sapphire highlighted that the README and probably a few other things need simplifying, reframing, or remixing
- Can we create a visualisation, whether graphic or a video, that introduces what we're trying to do as this will be more effective for many people

- [ ] Help make the README more accessible
- [ ] Get your ticket for London Tech Week
